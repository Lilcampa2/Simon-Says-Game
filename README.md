# Simon-Says-Game
## This game is a memory game I have created using my understanding of JQuery and JavaScript.
### Step 1: Press any key to start
### Step 2: Follow along with the sequence of random colors that are pressed from the game and try to copy the order of colors that are generated.
### Step 3: If you fail to press the colors that generated from the game in order then the game will signal you lost with a flashing red color and sound. All you have to do to start over is press any key to start the game over.

# Have fun playing my Simon Says Game :)
